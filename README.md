## User Experience Design
### **The Strategy Plane**

This project focuses on providing a well-structured, digestible approach to technical analysis in an introductory course format targeted at beginners. Learners will receive an introduction to the world of trading looking in-depth at the importance of technical analysis.

We start with a beginner’s guide to the financial marketplace; from there we take a deeper look at… This will provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of technical analysis and prepare the user to progress through further intermediate studies.


#### Site Goals
* To help users understand technical analysis and why it's an important fundamental when learning to trade
* To provide an easy to use web application from start to finish
* To provide a service for the user to easily interact with the course material 
* To provide an in depth introduction to technical analysis in a well presented, easy to read fashion


#### User stories
* As a user, I want the website to be responsive so that I can clearly view the webpages from my mobile, tablet or desktop
* As a user, I want to be able to register to the website so that my details can be saved
* As a user, I want the main purpose of the site to be clear so that I immediately know what the site is intended for upon entering
* As a user, I want to be able to search/filter modules so that i can easily find what I'm looking for
* As a user, I want to effortlessly be able to navigate the site so that I can find content quickly with ease
* As a user, I want to be able to return to the main site without having to use the browser buttons so that I can easily return to the website if I navigate to a page that doesn't exist

### **The Scope Plane**

**Features planned:**
* Responsive design
* CRUD Functionality
* Login functionality
* Logout functionality
* Profile Page
* Website title and information on the site to represent the product
* A MongoDB database to store user login/profile information
* Course module material displayed to registered users with the ability to search and filter through the data
* Registered user profile management including customization
* Navigation Menu (Site Wide)

### **The Structure Plane**
User Story:
> As a user, I want the website to be responsive so that I can clearly view the webpages from my mobile, tablet or desktop

Acceptance Criteria:
* Site must work on all device sizes without loss of design/information flow


Implementation:

The website will be designed mobile first, ensuring all content and webpages work flawlessly with any given device

User Story:
> As a user, I want to be able to register to the website so that my details can be saved for later use

Acceptance Criteria:
* A way for users to register an account 

Implementation:

Users will easily be able to create an account at all times regardless to where they are within the web application

User Story:
> As a user, I want to easily navigate the site so that I can find content quickly with ease.

Acceptance Criteria:
* Navigation menu to be displayed on all pages
* All navigation links redirect to the correct pages

Implementation:

A navigation menu will be displayed on all webpages. This will redirect users to the appropriate page when clicked. On smaller devices, the menu will collapse into a hamburger menu to make efficient use of screen 
space.

The navigation menu will contain the following items:

* Home - index.html
* Register - register.html
* Sign In - login.html
* Profile - profile.html
* Courses - courses.html
* About Us - about.html
* Sign Out - (redirects to home page)

User Story:
> As a user, I want to be able to register to the website so that I can create/manage my account

Acceptance Criteria:
* Sign up - Login and Logout functionality to be added
* User must have the ability to create, update and delete their profile attributes
* User must have a profile page displaying their basic details and courses they're currently on

Implementation:

A Registration page will be implemented that allows users to register for an account on the website. The username and password along with basic details for the users account will be stored in a MongoDB database collection called users

A Sign In page will be implemented to allow registered users the ability to login in to their account

Once a user has successfully logged in, they will be redirected to the home page page. The user will be able to edit their profile easily by clicking on their profile icon at the top-right of the navigation menu, allowing them to easily edit and change any information about themselves updating the records on the database. 

A Sign Out button will be displayed to users who are logged in. When clicked this will sign the user out of the website and redirect them to the home page.


A flash message will be shown to the user to alert them whether the task they have started has been successful or not, this includes the following:

* Logging into the website
* Logging out of the website
* Registering an account on the website
* Updating profile attributes
* Deleting profile

> As a user, I want the main purpose of the site to be clear so that I immediately know what the site is intended for upon entering

Acceptance Criteria:
* Information displayed about the website clearly to new users to indicate what the purpose of the website is

Implementation:
A banner with a background image will be presented on the home page to show to users what the website is about and who it's target audience is


>As a user, I want to be able to search/filter modules so that i can easily find what I'm looking for

Acceptance Criteria:
* A function to support searching through an index of modules listed on the website


Implementation:
A search bar will be implemented on the websites courses page (courses.html) to allow the user to search for a given module on a specific course they might be looking for, directing them to the course page the module they searched for contains

User Story:
> As a user, I want to be able to return to the main site without having to use the browser buttons so 
that I can easily return to the website if I navigate to a page that doesn't exist.

Acceptance Criteria:
* If a user redirects to the wrong page, an error will display that contains a link to go back to the main website.

Implementation:

A custom 404 page will be created so that if a user attempts to navigate to a page that it not found, an 
error will be displayed. This page will contain a link to allow the user to redirect back to the main website without needing to use the browser navigation buttons.

# Database Design
#### MongoDB Object format examples:

**Collection: users**
{
_id: Int
username: String
password: String
}

**Collection: comments**
{
_id: Int
comment: String
created_by: String
}


# Security

Database connection details are set up in an [env.py](https://pypi.org/project/env.py/) for development, for 
security reasons this is not uploaded to GitHub so that database and connection details are not visible to 
users. In production these are stored in Heroku. 


## **The Surface Plane**
### Design

#### Colour Scheme
  - The main background colour used for the website landing page: can be seen on ('home.html)
  - The secondary background colour used for the websites course page: can be seen on ('course.html)
  - The third background colour used for the websites landing page: can be seen on ('home.html)
  - The main colour used for typography including hover states


#### Typography
All the title typography used in this website inherits the google font 'Ubuntu' for a modern looking text font


#### Imagery
All images apart from the logo was sourced from [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/)


## Differences to Design
The side navigation bar was not in my initial design plan. I found a sidebar navigation that suited my app design perfectly so i used this instead of the standard navigation found on the majority of websites on the internet. The sidebar navigation used on this website can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEfaoAa99XY&list=LLtq7zXJyPFDANiQE5jmtrdg&index=1)

## Features

#### Existing Features
- A modules page that allows users to select which module they'd like to view
- Sign-up/Sign-in functionality to allow users to save their progress throughout the web application
- Feedback functionality to allow users to leave feedback on the website

### Features Left to Implement
* Additional courses added to the website 
* Functionality to support course search/filtering 
* A comments section for each course to leave feedback

## Testing
| Test | Area | Process | Result | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------- | 
| T1 | Global | The website was tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, firefox, IE) for responsive design. All tests passed without fail | Passed |
| T2 | Homepage | The home screen was first tested to ensure suitability and accuracy so that it responded well to all devices (mobile/tablet/desktop)| Passed |
| T3 | Global | Tested all buttons on the website worked as intended, this included testing the HREF links directed to the correct places | Passed|
| T4 | Course | Tested all of the module buttons on the course page to ensure they displayed the correct corrisponding information | Passed|
| T5 | Course | Tested all the modules display the corrisponding information relative to the module presented | Passed|
| T6 | Validation | Tested the 'Login/Register' buttons correctly validated the user input to ensure no boundaries were broken within the web application | Passed|

### Errors
| Error | Title | Analysis | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| E1 | Unresponsive |  During the developement process of this project the responsive design was flawed due to the side navigation bar being positioned 'Absoulute'. To resolve this I had to manually add a 'left' value of '78px' to move all content pages over to avoid collision with the navigation menu |
| E2 | Data |  During the developement process of this project the data fetched from the database wasn't displaying correctly, this was caused from a misspelling inside the feedback.html page |
| E3 | Unresponsive |  During the developement process of this project the modules page found on the course.html wasn't working along with the database. At first I stored all of the modules/data inside the MongoDB, This in course caused looping errors, in turn I resulted to hard coding all of the modules data inside the course.js |

#Validators 
* # **HTML**
    * No errors were returned when passing the **base.html** file through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org)

        #### **base.html**

        <img src="static/images/readme/images/html_val.png" alt="validator result" width="500" height="200"/>

        #### **home.html**

        When using the **calc** property, it flags as an error. Upon researching a solution I found that infact it is still valid CSS, source to this can be found [Here](https://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200911/vendor-specific_extensions_are_invalid_css/)

        <img src="static/images/readme/images/home_val.png" alt="validator result" width="500" height="200"/>

        
* # **CSS**
    * All of the following files were passed through the official [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator)

        #### **base.css**

        <img src="static/images/readme/images/base_val.png" alt="validator result" width="500" height="200"/>

        #### **home.css**

        <img src="static/images/readme/images/home_css_val.png" alt="validator result" width="500" height="200"/>


        #### **course.css**

        <img src="static/images/readme/images/course_val.png" alt="validator result" width="500" height="200"/>

        #### **about.css**

        <img src="static/images/readme/images/about_val.png" alt="validator result" width="500" height="200"/>

There are other HTML/CSS files found in this project but do inherit from the base.html/css files and pass the validators. I did not include every file as it seems unnecessary


### Test Strategy
#### **Summary**
**"Testing is required on all features and user stories documented in this README All clickable links must redirect to the correct pages. All forms linked to MongoDB must be tested to ensure they insert all given fields into the correct collections"**

HTML Code must pass through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri)

CSS Code must pass through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

JavaScript code must pass through the [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/)

Python Code must pass through [PEP8 Validator](http://pep8online.com/)


#### **Access Requirements**
Tester must have access to MongoDB in order to manually verify the insertion 
of records to users and events collections


#### **Assumptions and Dependencies**
Testing is dependent on the website being deployed live on Heroku


### Project Creation

**Note: The project will not run locally with database connections unless the user sets up an [env.py](https://pypi.org/project/env.py/) file configuring IP, PORT,
